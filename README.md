### Skills

During my previous incarnation, I led a number of team based projects, which involved creating and documenting technical work flows for my team - including slick, easy to follow training manuals.

My experiences in providing significant support and cover for management and the Operations Director have allowed me to apply analytical thinking to any project and provide valuable, technical support and data set analysis - always heavily involved in the development and implementing of new projects.

I’m flexible, and always keen to improve and learn new skills on the job whenever necessary - I feel it’s essential to bring new ideas and enthusiasm to any working environment.

I have always been keen to explore new ideas and technologies that push me out of my comfort zone.
